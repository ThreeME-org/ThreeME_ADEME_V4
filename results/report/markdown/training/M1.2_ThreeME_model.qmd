# The ThreeME model

-   **M**ulti-sector **M**acroeconomic **M**odel for the **E**valuation of **E**nvironmental and **E**nergy policy
-   Macroeconomic multi-sector model with neo-keynesian features
    -   Avoid the limitations of standard CGE models
        -   Say something about the medium term (not only the long term)
        -   More realistic results for policy makers
    -   Similar dynamic and long term properties than the macroeconomic models used in Economic ministries and forecasting departments
-   **Open source** model: www.threeme.org
    -   To avoid usual criticisms on models: black-box, impossible to verify independently the results, too few users
    -   Make application to other countries and by other institutions easier: EU, Mexico & Indonesia (AFD); Tunisia (UNEP), UK (OECD), Luxembourg (Statec), DG Trésor

# Multisector model

-   n sectors (e.g. France: n = 37; Tunisia: n = 21, Mexico: n = 24, Luxembourg: n = 26)

-   Allows to analyze the effect of transfer of activities from one sector to another on:

    -   Employment, due to different labor intensity
    -   Investment, due to different capital intensity
    -   Energy consumption, due to different energy intensity
    -   Trade balance, due to different propensity to import and export

# Example of sectoral decomposition

-   The economy is disaggregated into 27 sectors, with in particular:
    -   4 transport sectors
    -   12 energy sectors
        -   Of which 10 technologies for the production of electricity
-   And 23 commodities
    -   A commodity can be produced by several sectors
        -   Ex: electricity
-   The disaggregation is a compromise between the availability of the national account and energy data and the objective of the model
-   Several sectors have to be disaggregated
    -   Electricity and gas
    -   Transport

# Focus on energy

-   The energy disaggregation allows for analyzing the energy behavior of economic agents:
    -   **Sectors** can arbitrate between different energy investments:
        -   Substitution between capital & energy when the relative energy price increases
        -   Substitution between energy sources
        -   Substitution between transports
        -   Endogenous energy efficiency: technical progress increases when the relative energy price increases
    -   **Consumers**
        -   Substitution between capital & energy
        -   Substitution between energy sources
        -   Substitution between transports
        -   Substitution between goods

# Type of simulation of the economic and environmental impact

-   Energy transition policies
    -   Fiscal policies:
        -   Carbon tax with or without redistribution of the tax revenue
        -   Phasing out subsidies on (fossil fuel) energy
        -   Bonus-malus for cars: subsidies on green cars financed by a tax on other cars
    -   Change in the electricity production mix
        -   Ex: more RES in the mix
    -   Impact of green investment
        -   In buildings, public transport, etc.
        -   Impact of applying a new standard for buildings, or appliances
-   External shock
    -   Increase in international oil/gas price

# CGE model

-   **Computable:** numerical simulation
-   **General:** take into account the interactions between markets.
    -   Supply and demand influence each other
-   **Equilibrium:** Supply is equal to demand on all markets (good, production factors)
-   Structure of a CGE model (see next Figure):
    -   Demand (Consumption, investment) defines the supply (production)
    -   Supply defines in return the demand through the incomes generated by the production factors

# What does "general equilibrium" mean?

-   General Equilibrium relates to a state where supply is equal to demand in all markets
-   2 main approaches to insure this state:
    -   **Walrasian** models
        -   The equilibrium force is the price system
        -   Perfect price flexibility insure the instantaneous equilibrium between supply and demand
        -   When the supply of a commodity goes down, its price tends to go up, thereby stimulating additional supply and depressing demand, until supply and demand are equal again.
        -   Static model
    -   **Neo-Keynesian** models
        -   Demand determines supply
        -   Price and quantities are rigid and adjust slowly
        -   Disequilibrium between notional (optimal) supply and the actual supply in the short run
        -   Dynamic model: transition to the long run

# A neo-keynesian CGE model

-   **Slow adjustment** of price and quantity

    -   Adjustment costs
    -   Empirically firms adjust their production to the demand rather than their price

-   Leads to situation of **disequilibrium** between the desired supply and demand

-   **Prices** are defined as a mark-up over the firm's production costs

    -   Production costs integrate intermediary consumption (material and energy), labor and capital costs

# A neo-keynesian CGE model

-   Wages are determined by a **Wage Setting (WS) curve**
    -   Phillips curve: wages increase with inflation and decrease with unemployment
    -   Wages do not adjust instantaneously the supply and demand for labor:
        -   Permanent underemployment equilibrium possible
        -   Theory of the NAIRU (Non Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) or Equilibrium rate of unemployment
-   The **interest rate** does not equilibrate instantaneously saving and investment:
    -   It is defined by the Central Bank
    -   "Taylor" reaction function: increases with inflation, decreases with unemployment

# Key properties of ThreeME

-   **General equilibrium effects**
    -   Supply influence demand and vice versa
-   **Direct and indirect effects** of the energy transition
    -   Direct effects: impact for the energy sectors
    -   Indirect effects: impact for the rest of the economy (in particular the other sectors, the government, households).
-   **Limited eviction effects**
    -   Investment is not only defined by saving
    -   The financing through bank credit does not necessary lead to an increase of the interest rate
    -   The augmentation of investment in one sector is not necessary achieved through a decrease of investment in other sectors

# The value-added compared to existing models

-   Sectorial disaggregation
    -   Make explicit the negative and positive impacts for each sector according to its own specificities.\
-   High technological disaggregation of the energy system
    -   Ex: electricity produced by several technology
    -   Each technology having their own cost and production function
    -   Link between economic activity, energy production in physical terms (Mtoe or Mwh) and CO2 emissions more accurate.
-   General Equilibrium
    -   Allows for taking into account of indirect and feedback effects (rebound effects)
-   Neo-keynesian features
    -   Allows for studying transition and disequilibrium phases (such underemployment)

# The value-added compared to existing models

-   Hybrid modelling
    -   Link bottom-up and top-down approaches
    -   Detailed energy technologies and coherent macroeconomic framework
-   Possibility of combination with an energy system model
    -   The bottom-up development of the energy sectors makes it possible to combine ThreeME with an energy system model without loss of relevant information
    -   Assessment of scenarios compatible with the technical constraints regarding the feasible energy mix.

# Data: Supply-Use (SU) and Input-Output (IO) tables

-   SU table says how much a given commodities is supplied by a given sector (Supply)
    -   Generally close to a diagonal matrix
-   IO table says how much a given commodities is purchased by a given sector (Demand)
    -   Not a diagonal matrix

# Equilibrium between Supply and Demand (use)

-   GDP = VA = Y -- CI = C + I + X - M
