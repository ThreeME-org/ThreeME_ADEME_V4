# Model tools applied to climate change

-   Context
    -   To keep global warming from rising more than 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels, OECD countries are expected to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 80-95% by 2050 compared to 1990.
    -   Kyoto protocol where countries have agreed to meet emission reduction targets
    -   Accentuated by the global Paris' agreement in 2015 during the COP21
    -   Most countries have pledged to cut drastically GHG emissions
        -   Carbon neutrality
    -   Part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
        -   No trade off between economic & environmental objectives
        -   Environmental policy seen as an economic opportunity
        -   Energy security
        -   "Green" industry and technology use high skilled jobs

# Why do we need models?

-   Strong research need in economic evaluation
    -   Ex post and ex ante impact assessments of climate/energy policy
        -   Impact of the energy transition
    -   Need of new indicators (Beyond GDP)
-   Difficult task requiring a detailed analysis and a lot of data
    -   Many heterogeneous, targeted measures for many countries
-   Applied economic models: one of the main tools
    -   Costs & impact assessment of policy measures
-   But existing models have limits
    -   Lack of details or realism
    -   Research need in model development

# Limits of existing models

-   Measure poorly certain side effects of environmental policies
    -   Rebound effects & wealth effects
        -   Ex: house insulation for poor households
        -   Often energy consumption depends on revenue and not on the number of cars or buildings
        -   Often only one consumer
    -   Impact on inequality
    -   Endogenous energy efficiency
-   Say little about the short and medium term
    -   Maybe because climate change is a long term phenomenon
    -   Although most people agree on the long term beneficial effects of climate policy, the acceptability of climate policies depends on their short term impacts
        -   Ex: rejection of Kyoto by the USA; of the carbon tax in France
-   Effect on non-economic indicators
    -   Sustainability
    -   Environmental and social aspects of progress

# Bottom-up versus top-down approaches

-   **Bottom-up**: "from the detailed to the aggregate level"
    -   [Advantages:]{.underline} realism and high level of detail
    -   [Drawbacks:]{.underline} neglect indirect effects
        -   Ex: effect of energy savings on prices (which in return will affect energy savings themself)
-   **Top-down**: "from the aggregate to the detailed level"
    -   [Advantages:]{.underline} accounts for interactions/feedbacks
        -   Rebound effects: a lower energy bill means an extra revenue which in return may lead to more energy consumption
        -   Carbon leakage
    -   [Drawbacks:]{.underline} lack of details, unrealistic representation of certain economic behaviours such as energy consumption

# Universe of energy & climate models

![](pictures/models.jpg)

# Main existing models

-   Computational General Equilibrium Models (CGEM)

-   Neoclassical Integrated Assessment Models

-   Engineering models / energy system models

-   Hybrid models: combination of the three above

# Computational General Equilibrium Models (CGEM)

**ENV-Linkages (OECD), GTAP**

-   Walrasian models: perfect price flexibility guaranties equilibrium on each market at every period
-   Typical applications:
    -   Effect of the change in technical progress
        -   Climate change will degrade productivity in certain sectors. This will lead to the increase of the production price of these sectors. Agents will react/adapt by substituting goods or input
    -   Effect of a tax on emissions
-   Limits:
    -   Long term models: do not say much about the short and medium term.
        -   Ex: no unemployment
    -   Lack of details about the drivers of energy consumption

# Neoclassical Integrated Assessment Models

**DICE (Nordhaus)**

-   A representative agent maximizes the future welfare of the entire society by making a trade off between the benefits of economic growth (consumption) and its costs (emissions)
-   Typical applications:
    -   The value and trajectory of the optimal carbon tax
        -   Climate change has a cost in terms of (future) wealth but mitigation also has a cost. Weighing these 2 costs defines the optimal growth that allows the maximum wealth in the future
-   Limits:
    -   Perfect insight/information about the future
    -   Largely normative: an economic "dictator" who decides for all the society (the whole world)

# Engineering models / energy system models

**MARKAL, PRIMES (European Commission), POLES, LEAP.**

-   A representative agent minimizes the future energy costs of the society by choosing the optimal energy mix
-   Very detailed representation of all technical energy processes
    -   Costs (production, distribution, etc), availability
-   Typical applications
    -   When (or under which circumstances) a given technology will be profitable?
    -   How will the most cost effective energy mix evolve in the future?
-   Limits:
    -   Partial equilibrium: exogenous prices
        -   No vision of the global economic system
    -   Largely normative: the economic "dictator"
