##### Exception equations for ThreeME - France - ADEME

# Condition to avoid Y_toe[ce] become negative
# Will be corrected in the energy balance block by changing the import share equation
# see issue: 
@over Y_toe[ce] = (CI_toe[ce] + CH_toe[ce] + X_toe[ce] - M_toe[ce] > 0) * (CI_toe[ce] + CH_toe[ce] + X_toe[ce] - M_toe[ce] - 0.0001) + 0.0001 if Y_toe[ce] <> 0
