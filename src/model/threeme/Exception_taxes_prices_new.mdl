#####  Taxes on commodities & Prices per uses

## There are two versions regarding the specification of prices and taxes on commodities: (1) the basic version where taxes are not differentiated between uses (e.g. intermediary, final consumption, export, etc.) and type (e.g. VAT, subsidies, etc.); (2) the advanced version where this differentiation is made. \\

## This file provides the equations defining with more detail taxes and prices. In the basic version, taxes on commodities are not differentiated between uses. A constant average tax rate on each commodity is assumed. This has the advantage to require less data for the calibration. But this assumption is often unrealistic since taxes on commodities are generally differentiated per uses. For instance, VAT applies on household's final consumption but not on intermediary consumption or exports. Subsidies are generally higher for domestic than imported products. When the equations of this section are activated in ThreeME, the heterogeneity regarding the tax rates is taken into account. Additional data are required to disaggregate taxes. The average tax rate is not constant anymore and becomes an endogenous variable that depends on the evolution of structure of taxes and subsidies. To preserve the accountancy consistency of the model, prices have also to be amended compared to the basic version. \\

####  Taxes on commodities

##! Average tax rate on domestically produced commodity $c$
RNTAXCD[c] = NTAXCD_VAL[c] / (PYQ[c] * YQ[c])     if YQ[c] <> 0

## This rate become now endogenous by inverting the equation of $NTAXCD^{VAL}_{c}$. This specification ensures the accounting equality between the various GDP definition. \\

##! Average tax rate on imported commodity $c$
RNTAXCM[c] = NTAXCM_VAL[c] / (PM[c]  * M[c] )   if M[c] <> 0

##! Net taxes on domestically produced commodity $c$ expressed in value

## This is not defined anymore by simply assuming a constant rate over the production value: $NTAXCD^{VAL}_{c} = RNTAXCD_{c}*PYQ_{c}*YQ_{c}$. Different taxes are now defined depending on their basis which may differ between user (see below).  \\
