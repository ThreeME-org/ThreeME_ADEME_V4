### Margins supplied (value & volume):
# TO BE CHANGED !!: Margins paid --> Margins used / Margins supplied -->  margins supplied
## The margins supplied by commodity $m$ corresponds to the margins supplied by this commodity. By definition, the margins supplied is the sum of the margins paid (or used) on the commodities $c$. \\ \\
## The margins paid on domestic and imported products ($MGPD_{m, c}$ and $MGPM_{m, c}$) are defined with behavioral equations in the producer block. They follow the domestic and imported production of commodity $c$ ($YQ_{c}$ and $M_{c}$) more or less proportionally depending on the possibility of substitutions between margins. The margins paid are then aggregated to define the margins supplied, $MGS_{m}$. The latter is then disaggregated between the domestic and imported margins supplied ($MGSD_{c}$ and $MGSM_{c}$). See specification in the producer block. \\

## $YQS_{c}$ is the volume of the production expressed at market price. It should not be seen as a composite of several ``goods``: production at base price, margins and taxes. Its does not increase when the volume of the margins and taxes increase. The price does instead. This is equivalent to assuming that $YQS_{c}$ is always proportional to and $YQ_{c}$ since the volume of margins and taxes depends on the latter. Writing it following the specification composite of several goods, $YQS_{c} = YQ_{c} + MGPD_{c} + NTAXCD_{c}$, would lead to inaccurate results since a decrease in the quantity of margins used per unit of production would not lead to a decrease of the selling price. \\
