#### Household 

### Energy  consumption defined by NEAM
NCH[ce] = CH_HOUS_NEAM[ce] + CH_TRSP_NEAM[ce]

### Automobile investment defined by NEAM
NCH[cveh] = CH_TRSPINV_NEAM

### Housing investment defined by NEAM
NCH[ccon] = CH_HOUSINV_NEAM 

### Public transport defined by NEAM

# This will deactivate the endogenous approacheed used in the OECD version:
