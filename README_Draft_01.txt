WHY DID WE CHOOSE TO RELEASE ThreeME AS OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE?

ThreeME is a macroeconomic, multi-sectoral, dynamic model of neo-keynesian inspiration. In particular, it is well suited to estimate the economic impact of environmental and energy policy. The ThreeME team does its utmost to ensure that the model produces relevant results. Nonetheless, the ThreeME model comes with absolutely no warranty or guarantee regarding the correctness and accuracy of all results. Users cannot derive any rights from results, comments or recommendations found from ThreeME. Moreover any results derided from ThreeME or a modified version of it by the user as well as the conclusions the user may draw from them is the user's sole, full and entire responsibility. 

There is currently no consensus amongst economists on what constitutes the “correct” representation of the economy. This is a direct consequence of the controversies between various schools of economic thought that still divide economists between (neo)classics, (neo)Keynesians, (neo)Marxists, heterodox, etc. It also stems from the difficulty to provide strong empirical validations to a given economic theory. 

Results obtained by economic models are highly dependent on their hypotheses and therefore on the theoretical assumptions of the modeler. With the development of computing power, the complexity of economic models has increased significantly allowing for instance to account for a large number of sectors. As a drawback, results have become more difficult to analyze and therefore to understand.

In this context, several reasons guide the choice of releasing ThreeME under an open source license:
- Since progress in economics requires the reproducibility of findings, it is important that independent parties can replicate the results obtained with a model. An open source model provides the opportunity to measure the impact a specific modeling or calibration hypothesis has, and therefore to confront theories.
- An open source model increases transparency, by allowing independent verification of the assumptions and hypotheses leading a specific result.
- We hope this release can encourage and facilitate the interaction between experts from different backgrounds by providing a common language to confront hypotheses, to discuss the implications of modeling choices, or to share developments across modeling teams.
- This approach can also be understood as an act of humility from the modeler. It acknowledges that economic modeling is a very difficult task and that the modeler is far from infallible. Beyond the controversies between theories, misunderstanding the results of a model often proceeds from human mistakes. The growing size of economic models increases the risk of error in the specification of economic behaviors or in the database used to calibrate the model. Sharing the source code of the model is a way to mitigate this risk. 

The choice for a GNU General Public License version 3 has being driven by these four guiding principles. It requires that changes to the software must be published and/or distributed under the same license. The ThreeME team encourages users to publish under a GNU General Public License version 3 the ThreeME version (including any modification) they have used to make a public statement (e.g. the publication of ThreeME results in a study) in order tom allow for result replication. Since the views expressed by the user(s)/author(s) do not necessarily represent the views of the THreeME team, it should not be suggested in any way that it does. Any results and conclusions derided from ThreeME or a modified version of is the user's sole, full and entire responsibility.

HOW TO USE THREEME ?

NOTE ABOUT THIS VERSION

The project ThreeME has been initiated in 2008 by Gaël Callonnec and Frédéric Reynès. 

 
Thank ADEME for the financial support. 
Frédéric Reynès suppervise the devellpepement of the model. 
Gaël Callonnec is the technical XXX from the side of the ADEME.


This is version 4 of ThreeME. Whereas previous versions were running exclusively with the software EViews (<https://www.eviews.com/>), this version can be run fully in R (<https://www.r-project.org/>). 

The EViews solver may be still be used in particular to simulate big size version of the model. In this case, a license of the software EViews must be purchased and install on your computer. This functionality has only be tested on Windows operating system.


The program is composed of the folling key script.
